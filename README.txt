A simple 2D game engine that I built using OpenGL 4.3 and GLFW which features:

- A single shader renderer which utilizes batch rendering (or buffer re-specification - https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Buffer_Object_Streaming#Buffer_re-specification)
- A simple text renderer
- A sad, basic AABB - AABB collision detection that barely works
- A sample game I've written which is similar to the 1976 Breakout game
